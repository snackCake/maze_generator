# Maze Generator
An entry for week 41 of the Nerdery JVM code challenge.

To run, just use:

    sbt run

To get your random, printable maze PDF, just go to:

    http://localhost:9000

Note: The maze is inside the thin lines, not outside. It is generated as ASCII art, using Unicode box characters.
That seemed like a good idea at the time, but if I was going to keep going, I'd actually draw it using PDF vectors.
